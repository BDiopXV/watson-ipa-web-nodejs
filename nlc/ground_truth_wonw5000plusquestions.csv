As it formulates a response, Watson applies advanced analytics to generate hypotheses, weigh and evaluate relevant evidence, and identify the information that is most likely to be useful.

Search engines become less accurate as more information is introduced to the search. Search engines scan the internet for content; some good, some bad. Search relies on factors such as keywords to bring up thousands of web pages that may - or may not -- hold the answer to what a user is asking. Watson is able to leverage additional information to become increasingly precise. Companies today have an abundance of information, most of it in an unstructured form that is not stored in database rows and columns and is therefore unusable by most traditional computing systems. Watson can help you to extract meaning from big data.

Watson.</p><p>In February 2011, the team realized their goal and exceeded expectations when Watson appeared on Jeopardy! and beat the two highest ranked players in a two-game match. The competition was the ultimate test of the machine's capabilities because it relied on many human cognitive abilities that are traditionally considered to be beyond the capability of computers, such as:</p><p>- Discern double meanings of words, puns, rhymes, and inferred hints.</p><p>- Respond rapidly.</p><p>- Process vast amounts of information to make complex and subtle logical connections.</p><p>For the Watson team, replicating these capabilities was an enormous challenge, because it moved beyond keyword searches and queries of structured data to accessing and assessing a vast amount of unstructured data to find the best answers.

However, if you can copy text from a PDF document and paste it into another document, Watson is likely to be able to extract the text. The following factors might help explain the issues:</p><p>-- Sometimes you can view and print a PDF file with no problems, yet Watson cannot extract the text from the document. This issue occurs because the PDF document is a scanned image and not a text file. To test whether your PDF is an image, save the file as text. If the new file is blank, your PDF is likely a scanned image of text and cannot be processed.</p><p>-- Another issue with extracting text occurs when the fonts in the PDF do not contain enough information to allow text to be extracted. For example, when you copy the text and paste it to another document, you see shapes and symbols, not text.

As it formulates a response, Watson applies advanced analytics to generate hypotheses, weigh and evaluate relevant evidence, and identify the information that is most likely to be useful. See <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_cqBP08yuA%2522%20%5Co%20%2522(Opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab%20or%20window)%2522%20%5Ct%20%2522_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_cqBP08yuA</a>.</p><p>Watson is not a search engine. Search engines become less accurate as more information is introduced to the search. Search engines scan the internet for content; some good, some bad. Search relies on factors such as keywords to bring up thousands of web pages that may - or may not -- hold the answer to what a user is asking. Watson is able to leverage additional information to become increasingly precise. Companies today have an abundance of information, most of it in an unstructured form that is not stored in database rows and columns and is therefore unusable by most traditional computing systems.

As it formulates a response, Watson applies advanced analytics to generate hypotheses, weigh and evaluate relevant evidence, and identify the information that is most likely to be useful.

Search engines become less accurate as more information is introduced to the search. Search engines scan the internet for content; some good, some bad. Search relies on factors such as keywords to bring up thousands of web pages that may - or may not -- hold the answer to what a user is asking. Watson is able to leverage additional information to become increasingly precise. Companies today have an abundance of information, most of it in an unstructured form that is not stored in database rows and columns and is therefore unusable by most traditional computing systems.

The team dubbed the system <i>Watson</i> as a tribute to the founder of the International Business Machines Corporation, Thomas J. Watson.</p><p>In February 2011, the team realized their goal and exceeded expectations when Watson appeared on Jeopardy! and beat the two highest ranked players in a two-game match. The competition was the ultimate test of the machine's capabilities because it relied on many human cognitive abilities that are traditionally considered to be beyond the capability of computers, such as:</p><p>- Discern double meanings of words, puns, rhymes, and inferred hints.</p><p>- Respond rapidly.</p><p>- Process vast amounts of information to make complex and subtle logical connections.</p><p>For the Watson team, replicating these capabilities was an enormous challenge, because it moved beyond keyword searches and queries of structured data to accessing and assessing a vast amount of unstructured data to find the best answers. IBM knew that the solution to this challenge had the potential to change the way businesses use information and make decisions.

Working with the electronics team, it took about a week to rig up a connection between Watson and an electronic solenoid plunger, which is a tightly wound coil, to press the buzzer. At one point the plunger made a loud clanking sound when it pressed the button - not something that could happen on TV. The team deadened the sound with a clear acrylic cover that also gave the &quot;thumb&quot; its attractive cylindrical appearance.</p><p>But the team had bigger problems than a noisy clicker. Players can't press the buzzer until host Alex Trebek finishes reading the clue and a light under the game board appears. Watson could not hear the clue or see the light. It was instead sent a signal indicating when the light turned on. Coordinating the timing - ensuring that Watson would wait the required minimum of four milliseconds it might take a human to respond - turned out to be a challenge.

Search engines become less accurate as more information is introduced to the search. Search engines scan the internet for content; some good, some bad. Search relies on factors such as keywords to bring up thousands of web pages that may - or may not -- hold the answer to what a user is asking. Watson is able to leverage additional information to become increasingly precise.

These configurations each represent a cluster of processors.</p><ul><li>Production.</li></ul><p>The production configuration is the primary application execution mode for IBM Watson. It is how the system is deployed to support an IBM Watson application or service for multiple concurrent users. As shown in the figure, the main question answering service can be thought of as a processing pipeline that takes a question and its contextual information as input and returns a set of top answers together with supporting evidence.</p><p>The processing pipeline is exposed through a formal application programming interface (API) that is remotely accessible.</p><p>In front of this processing pipeline is the IBM Watson solution, such as an IBM Watson Advisor. This solution tier includes the user interface to the solution, any needed integration into the work flow into which the solution is deployed, and integration with data sources that might be needed to provide context questions posed to the processing pipeline. This tier is also where the state of the interaction with the user is managed. Interaction between the solution tier and the question answering service is through the API.</p><ul><li>Customization.</li></ul><p>The customization configuration is for system development and testing. Like the production configuration, it includes the processing pipeline, but is scaled out in a very different way, so as to best support the customization of the processing to a specific problem. In this configuration, a domain expert or developer can submit batches of questions to IBM Watson to answer and then analyzes the results. These batches of questions along with the changes to the processing pipeline or knowledge content are called an <i>experiment</i>.</p><p>A set of tools supports the customization environment by providing the means to create question sets, submit and monitor experiments, and deeply analyze the results. A job manager component allocates cluster resources to individual experiments. Experiment analysis determines the accuracy of the system in correctly answering questions and helps identify what additional customization might be needed to improve this accuracy.</p><p>This configuration also supports the process of training IBM Watson. The processing pipeline employs statistical machine learning at several stages through models that must be trained over a large set of input. The training data consists of questions with known correct answers. Customization of IBM Watson is accomplished by feeding it new content and by modifying its processing pipeline. These modifications can take the form of updates to customization files, such as a new lexicon for domain-specific terms, or new analysis components. New analysis components can be added into the processing pipeline according to the UIMA model.</p><ul><li>Content ingestion.</li></ul><p>The content ingestion configuration performs processing on content to be used by IBM Watson to build up its base of knowledge. IBM Watson can ingest textual data and structured information such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples. Ingestion processing includes natural language preprocessing of text corpora, the creation of derived data resources such as search indexes, and a knowledge base. The content ingestion configuration is really more than one processing environment. Sentence boundary detection, needed for the advanced passage search capability in IBM Watson, and natural language preprocessing employ IBM Watson LiteScale to process in parallel the potentially huge volumes of text being fed to IBM Watson. Other tasks such as building a knowledge base from relationships extracted from the processed text, use the batch processing and job management capability of the customization configuration.</p><p>The processing pipeline is common to both the production configuration and the customization configuration. Parts of the early phases of the pipeline are also run in the content ingestion configuration.</p>",TRUE,1000037912,What language does Watson speak?,"<h1 class=""topicTitle"">Watson language support</h1> <p>Watson is currently English-only.

Watson.</p><p>In February 2011, the team realized their goal and exceeded expectations when Watson appeared on Jeopardy! and beat the two highest ranked players in a two-game match. The competition was the ultimate test of the machine's capabilities because it relied on many human cognitive abilities that are traditionally considered to be beyond the capability of computers, such as:</p><p>- Discern double meanings of words, puns, rhymes, and inferred hints.</p><p>- Respond rapidly.</p><p>- Process vast amounts of information to make complex and subtle logical connections.</p><p>For the Watson team, replicating these capabilities was an enormous challenge, because it moved beyond keyword searches and queries of structured data to accessing and assessing a vast amount of unstructured data to find the best answers.

Watson.</p><p>In February 2011, the team realized their goal and exceeded expectations when Watson appeared on Jeopardy! and beat the two highest ranked players in a two-game match. The competition was the ultimate test of the machine's capabilities because it relied on many human cognitive abilities that are traditionally considered to be beyond the capability of computers, such as:</p><p>- Discern double meanings of words, puns, rhymes, and inferred hints.</p><p>- Respond rapidly.</p><p>- Process vast amounts of information to make complex and subtle logical connections.</p><p>For the Watson team, replicating these capabilities was an enormous challenge, because it moved beyond keyword searches and queries of structured data to accessing and assessing a vast amount of unstructured data to find the best answers.

In this case, iterating over the annotations, one first obtains annotations that come sequentially first in the text, while favoring shorter annotations, in the case where two annotations start at the same offset.</p>",TRUE,1000013753,facebook,,FALSE,1000013754,i hate you,,FALSE,1000013755,who is vp of core?,"<h1 class=""topicTitle"">Who is Jerome Pesenti?</h1> <p>Jerome Pesenti is Vice President, Core Technology, for IBM Watson.
